# HACKberry
HACKberry is a practical model for daily use created through the cooperation of actual users.

Hackberries, which are a species of trees included in the elm family, grow many branches.

Our goal is to develop an artificial arm that would become the platform upon which developers and artificial arm users from all over the world are able to build as they wish.

The name represents our vision to “hack” at problems, grow branches of joy that reach out to users and enable their ideas and efforts to bear fruit (“berries”).
